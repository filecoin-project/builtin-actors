/*!
 * The VM module is replicated in this code tree temporarily. This is the high-level abstract interface
 * for a virtual-machine that can execute Filecoin WASM actors. It defines the high-level virtual-machine
 * interface, associated error and trace types and an interface to inject/override the behaviour of
 * certain primitives for the purpose of running tests.
 *
 * TODO(alexytsu): It should eventually be moved to an external location so that it can be shared
 * with the anorth/fvm-workbench implementation
